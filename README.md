# Mini Crazy Swords
This is a game developed in DIO bootcamp Santander 2024 - Criando Jogos com Godot

I followed all the instructions and I changed the following:
 - HP bar showed with the UI, not with the player
 - random damage by the enemies 

The game can be played in [Itch.io](https://thalitacolofatti.itch.io/mini-crazy-swords)

and [Kenney's Particle pack](https://kenney.nl/assets/particle-pack)
